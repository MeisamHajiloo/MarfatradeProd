# Marfa Trade SPA Conversion

This project has been successfully converted from a traditional multi-page PHP application to a Single Page Application (SPA) with client-side routing.

## Key Changes

### 1. SPA Architecture
- **Main SPA File**: `spa.php` - The single entry point for the application
- **Router**: `app.js` - Contains the SPA router and view management system
- **URL Routing**: All routes are handled client-side with proper browser history support

### 2. File Structure
```
├── spa.php                 # Main SPA entry point
├── app.js                  # SPA router and view manager
├── api/                    # All API endpoints (unchanged)
├── assets/
│   ├── css/
│   │   └── spa.css         # Additional SPA-specific styles
│   └── js/
│       ├── slider.js       # Slider functionality
│       ├── counter.js      # Counter animation
│       └── profile-functions.js # Profile management
├── .htaccess              # Updated for SPA routing
└── [old-files].php       # Converted to redirects
```

### 3. Routing System
The SPA supports the following routes:
- `/` - Home page with slider and counter
- `/products` - Products listing with filters
- `/product?slug=...` - Individual product details
- `/profile` - User profile (requires authentication)
- `/tickets` - Support tickets (requires authentication)
- `/about-us` - About page
- `/contact-us` - Contact page
- `/faq` - FAQ page

### 4. Authentication Integration
- Seamless authentication state management
- Protected routes automatically redirect to home if not authenticated
- User menu updates dynamically based on auth status

### 5. Legacy Support
- All old PHP files redirect to corresponding SPA routes with 301 redirects
- Query parameters are preserved during redirects
- API endpoints remain unchanged for backward compatibility
